# FitForge — AI-Powered Fitness Planner

**Predicts daily calorie needs and generates personalized workout & diet plans using Machine Learning**

</div>

---

## Overview

FitForge is a lightweight **machine learning-based fitness planning system** that helps users build **data-driven workout and diet plans**.

It predicts daily calorie requirements using a trained ML model and maps user goals (fat loss, muscle gain, maintenance) to structured fitness routines — all through a fast, interactive web interface.

---

## Features 

- Input body metrics (**age, height, weight, goal**)  
- Predict **daily calorie requirements (ML-based)**  
- Generate **goal-specific workout routines**  
- Get **personalized diet recommendations**  
- Clean **Streamlit dashboard UI**  
- Real-time fitness plan generation  
- Goal-based insights  

---

## Sample Flow

Enter your profile → Select fitness goal → Click **Generate Plan** → Get your complete AI-powered fitness roadmap instantly

---

## Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satwiktelang18/FitForge.git
cd FitForge
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open browser at: http://localhost:8501

---

## How It Works

1. User inputs body metrics (age, height, weight, goal)  
2. Data is preprocessed and normalized  
3. ML model predicts daily calorie requirements  
4. Workout engine maps goal → structured routines  
5. Diet engine generates calorie-aligned meal plans  
6. Results displayed via Streamlit UI

## Model Insights

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Target Variable:** Daily Calorie Requirement  
- **Input Features:** Age, Height, Weight, Fitness Goal  

---

## Model Performance 

- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **R² Score:** 0.9738  
- **MAE:** 81.95 calories  
- **RMSE:** 101.78 calories  

---

### Key Insights 

- The model explains **~97% of the variance** in calorie requirements (high predictive power)
- Average prediction error is **~82 calories**, which is reasonably low for fitness estimation
- Most important factor: **Activity Level**, followed by **Weight**

> Note: Model trained on structured fitness-related dataset. Performance may vary for real-world users.
